# Indonesian Spell Checker

We made an experiment to build Indonesian spell checker by using Norvig and N-gram algorithm. This project was made for one of our university works. Norvig and N-gram have been widely used in the field of spell checker. We want to find out the performance of the combination of both algorithms on Indonesian language spell checker. In addition, we also used Kneser-Ney algorithm to normalize the N-gram in order to get better results. We implement our model with the help of [KenLM](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm/tree/master) tool kit.

We retrieved our dataset from [Leipzig Corpora Collection](https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/Indonesian). We use 1 million Indonesian sentence collected from news article in 2022 for our training dataset and 10 thousand Indonesian sentence collected from news article in 2019 for our testing dataset.

We opened our project publicly in hope of this project may give new insights to the readers. Thank you for reading.
